# Debug Challenges: JavaScript

The skinny: You've been presented with a simle jQuery accordion. The accordion's click events are activating a particular set of styles that show and hide each section's related content.

The problem: Clicking on a section's heading to reveal the associated content appears to be working correctly, however, it seems that after clicking a different heading, the previous panel remains visible. Our accordion should only display only one panel at a time, and collapse all visible panels when a new section is selected.

1. Open index.html in your web browser.
2. Modify the code until the challenge is satisfied.
