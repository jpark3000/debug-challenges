# Debug Challenges: JavaScript

The skinny: You've been presented with a simle jQuery accordion.  This accordion's click events are activating a particular set of styles that show and hide each sections related content.

The problem: Clicking on a sections heading to reveal the associated content appears to be working correctly, however, it seems like when we click on a different panel, The previous panel seems to remain visible.  It is expected that our accorion only display one panel at a time, and collapse all visible panels when a new section is selected.

1. Open index.html in your web browser.
2. Modify the code until the challenge is satisfied.

HINT: Take a peek at this challenges app.js file. Something is missing.
